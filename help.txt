In this program, you will be presented with a series of options, with explanations in each menu. The hierarchy of the system is
laid out below. Lines with stars before them represent possible choices, with the term in quotation marks after representing
what entry is needed to reach the corresponding menu. Entries are not case sensitive. Lines without stars indicate
content that will appear automatically in the menu indicated by a star directly above it. To return to the previous menu, enter the term
in parentheses at the next highest level. To exit the program completely, return to the Main Menu and enter "Quit".
